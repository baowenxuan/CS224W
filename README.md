# CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs

This project is the solution to homeworks of [Stanford CS224W](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/), Fall 2019. Course videos could be found on YouTube or bilibili. 

Most of the solutions will be provided in Jupyter Notebook, for its brilliant interactive environment to display charts and figures.
